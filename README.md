# 🧹 Data Cleaning and EDA 

All the preprocessing and expolatory analysis were done in the python using pandas , numpy , matplolib and seaborn

Steps Performed :
- Handelled the missing values by filling them using mean/mode in the numeric columns.
- Handelled the missing values by filling Unknown in the string columns.
- Converted the data types of the columns.
- Gathered insights by performing some basics visuaization in EDA
- Generated summary satistics using describe() and Correlation analysis.
